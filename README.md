# Favella
This is a project I have worked on for a Computer Graphics course in university.
The assignment was to create a favella neighborhood, which was supposed to look like a maze. <br />

**The maze contains different objects like:** <br />
•Buildings that change height and texture <br />
•Trees that also change their texture <br />
•Street lamps <br />
•Fountains <br />
•Staircases <br />
•Bridges <br />
•Rivers <br />
•Boxwood <br />

**The interactive panel allows the following changes:** <br />
•Intensity and color of the light coming from the street lamps <br />
•Intensity and color of the scene light <br />
•Day/Night mode <br />

# Libraries used:
CSG.js <br />
dat.gui.min.js <br />
OrbitControls.js <br />
three.min.js <br />

# Warning
To all the students from my university who happen to look at the project, you are now officially warned that you'll most likely be caught if you decide to copy my code and submit it as yours as most of our assignments are tested for plagiarism and saved for some period of time.
