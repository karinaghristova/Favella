# Favella
This is a project I have worked on for a Computer Graphics course in university.
The assignment was to create a favella neighborhood, which was supposed to be built like a maze. <br />

The maze contains different objects like: <br />
•Buildings that change height and texture <br />
•Trees that also change their texture <br />
•Street lamps <br />
•Fountains <br />
•Staircases <br />
•Bridges <br />
•Rivers <br />
•Boxwood <br />

The interactive panel allows the following changes: <br />
•Intensity and color of the light coming from the street lamps <br />
•Intensity and color of the scene light <br />
•Day/Night mode <br />
